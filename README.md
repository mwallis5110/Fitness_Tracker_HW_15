## Installation Instructions
In order to initialize the program, users should open it in an integrated terminal and type "npm i" to isntall any node packages. Then, entering "npm run seed" will seed pre-populated data into the program. Finally, entering "nodemon server.js" will allow it to be viewed on localhost:3000, although it can be viewed normally at https://fitness-tracker-hw-15.herokuapp.com/.

## Using the Program
After initializing the program, users will be prompted to create a new workout by clicking the "New Workout" button. This will give users the option to select between "resistence" and "cardio", then entering information on the type, duration, etc. of their workout. These stats are then displayed on the main Fitness Tracker page.
